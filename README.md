# Enchantment Config

This is an archive of the Enchantment Config repository.

As of 24w18a, Mojang has introduced data driven enchantments, making basically all of this mod obsolete.

However, you are free to check out [Enchantment Disable Tag](https://github.com/GreenhouseTeam/enchantment-disable-tag), which just contains the enchantment disabling tag from this mod.

Happy datapacking in 1.21!
